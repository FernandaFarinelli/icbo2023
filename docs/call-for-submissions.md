<br><br>
All submissions should be in Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF) and should follow the [CEUR-ART template](./papers/CEUR-Template-1col.docx), single column. Microsoft Office Word, Open Office and LaTeX templates can be downloaded at [http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-XXX/CEURART.zip](http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-XXX/CEURART.zip) 
<br><br>
There is also an Overleaf Template available here: [https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/template-for-submissions-to-ceur-workshop-proceedings-ceur-ws-dot-org/hpvjjzhjxzjk](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/template-for-submissions-to-ceur-workshop-proceedings-ceur-ws-dot-org/hpvjjzhjxzjk)    

### Journal of Biomedical Semantics ICBO Thematic Series Option
**Journal Track submission date: *March 31st***. <br>
- In partnership with the [Journal of Biomedical Semantics](https://jbiomedsem.biomedcentral.com/), manuscripts submitted to the ICBO Thematic Series of this journal will be published immediately after acceptance and presented in the main ICBO conference following acceptance. 
- For this track, we suggest submission by **March 31st** at the latest for **full consideration for the conference**. <br>
- Later submission is possible, but the authors bear the risk that the review will not be available in time. <br>
- Journal track manuscripts are submitted directly to the [Journal of Biomedical Semantics](https://jbiomedsem.biomedcentral.com/) following the journal submission [guidelines](https://jbiomedsem.biomedcentral.com/submission-guidelines). **Authors must select the ICBO thematic series during the submission process.** 


## Poster preparation guideline
- Posters session will be just in-person.
- Porters should be built in A0 paper size, vertically (portrait) orientation, paper or fabric material.
- We will provide a template with details soon.
<!-- The poster boards are self-standing with legs, four feet wide by three feet high (landscape). The fabric is grey on one sidle and black on the other. Light-weight posters, photos, and couments can be affixed to the displays using thumbtacks.

Therefore, the maximum size of your poster will be 4’ wide by 3’ high.  -->
